Gutenberg block to serve China-based video to Chinese audience and YouTube video to everyone else.

== Description ==

This Gutenberg block allows for embedding a video in a WordPress post or page.  If the user who views the page is in China, a different video will show from users in the rest of the world.  This is to appropriately deal with China's Internet wall.

For more information on how to develop this block, please see the [github repo](https://github.com/cncf/china-video-block).
